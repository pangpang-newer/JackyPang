            <p class="p1">
                I am interested in working in the Mainland after graduation, especially in Beijing, so I am looking forward to working and developing in Mainland during my university years, experiencing the working environment and culture, learning teamwork and understanding how a team can work effectively in team cooperation. I believe this internship will help me accumulate working experience and I hope I can create my own value during the internship.
                I am currently studying Civil and Environmental Engineering at the Hong Kong Metropolitan University. I am also very interested in popular web technologies and emerging technologies. I am currently studying web design, and familiar with designing web layout and creating web content, using HMTL, CSS, C++, SQL and hands on with word and powerpoint software.
                After graduation, I would like to work in engineering related field to apply my skills in school and also consider working in internet because internet technology is developing rapidly and has a great impact on the development of society. If I get the internship opportunity, I believe that this opportunity can help me to have certain advantages in finding related jobs after graduation, and can let me know the operation of related industries as early as possible, apply what I have learned so far, and recognize my own shortcomings in advance, and I hope I can contribute to your company to do what I can. I have learned about geological engineering and water treatment such as drinking water and sewage treatment. and also knowledge about website development.
                I believe that my work experience will bring me more growth than school. Hope learning more work experience through this internship in the Greater Bay Area. Thank you very much if you offer me a chance.
