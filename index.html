                I am currently studying Civil and Environmental Engineering . I am also very interested in popular web technologies and emerging technologies. I am currently studying web design, and familiar with designing web layout and creating web content, using HMTL, CSS, C++, SQL and hands on with word and powerpoint software.
                After graduation, I would like to work in engineering related field to apply my skills in school and also consider working in internet because internet technology is developing rapidly and has a great impact on the development of society. If I get the internship opportunity, I believe that this opportunity can help me to have certain advantages in finding related jobs after graduation, and can let me know the operation of related industries as early as possible, apply what I have learned so far, and recognize my own shortcomings in advance, and I hope I can contribute to your company to do what I can. I have learned about geological engineering and water treatment such as drinking water and sewage treatment. and also knowledge about website development.
