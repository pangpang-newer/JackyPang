            <p class="p1">
                I am interested in working in the Mainland after graduation experiencing the working environment and culture, learning teamwork, and understanding how a team can work effectively in team cooperation. I believe this internship will help me accumulate work experience and I hope I can create my own value during the internship.
              Currently, I am Civil and Environmental Engineering student. Studying web design, and familiar with designing web layouts and creating web content, using HMTL, CSS, C++, SQL, and hands-on with word and PowerPoint software.
                After graduation, I would like to work in an engineering-related field to apply my skills in school and also consider working on the internet because internet technology is developing rapidly and has a great impact on the development of society. If I get the internship opportunity, I believe that this opportunity can help me to have certain advantages in finding related jobs after graduation
                I believe that my work experience will bring me more growth than in school. Hope to gain more work experience through this internship in the Greater Bay Area. Thank you very much if you offer me a chance.
